# Micro-Frontend Example: Child

To run locally: `npm run buildrun`.

This will host the webcomponent at `localhost:3000/main.js`.

If you want to host the component elsewhere, use `npm run build` and use the generated `main.js` file from the `/dist` folder.

To test the component, remember to set the `local` variable in `app.module.ts` to `true`.
